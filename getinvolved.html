            <h3>Join as a <strong>General Body Member</strong> to attend events and earn points!</h3>
            <p>General Body members come to our events such as pet a puppies and general body events and engage with our
                dogs in a more informal context. At the end of every semester, General Body Members with the most points
                and who have gotten to know the E-board/Raisers on a closer level will be selected to go through
                training with Guiding Eyes.</p>

            <p>As a sitter, you can work with the dogs as per your schedule for varying hours per week and help out
                raisers by taking care of a dog during your free time. Some sitters choose to have dogs in class with
                them, or even overnight on occasion.</p>

            <h3>After sitting for one semester, you are eligible to become a <strong>Raiser</strong>.</h3>
            <p>Raisers provide a home to the dog, teach the dog good social skills and house manners, and communicate
                with Guiding Eyes for the Blind to ensure the success of the future guide dog. From skills like nail
                clipping to walking nicely on a leash, raisers show dogs how they are expected to act, preparing a
                confident and people-loving puppy for their future work. Being a raiser at Cornell means you also must
                bring your dogs to events including pet a puppies and general body meetings, along with helping to train
                our new sitters.</p>

                    <p>As a global leader in breeding and genetics, <strong>Guiding Eyes employs industry best
                            practices</strong> in their approach to continually improving the health, temperament, and
                        success of our dogs. Their <strong>data-driven approach</strong>, together with their
                        <strong>partnerships with other guide dog organizations, specialists, and universities</strong>
                        helps to promote <strong>genetic diversity</strong> and ensure that each generation of dogs is
                        better than the one before.
                    <p>

                    <p>Guiding Eyes staff in the Genetics & Breeding department utilize data, called <strong>Estimated
                            Breeding Values</strong>, to determine which dogs join the breeding program to produce the
                        next generation of guide dogs and to match broods (moms) and studs (dads) together for litters
                        by taking into account a variety of variables.</p>

                    <p>Volunteers take groups of puppies for <strong>home socialization</strong>. The Early Training &
                        Socialization Program is a crucial program that helps the puppies get the right start on the
                        long path to becoming guide dogs. An Early Socializer works with the puppy, introducing them to
                        new environments and experiences. These repeated positive new experiences help the pups build
                        confidence and develop simple, yet important, skills.</p>

                    <p>Puppies are then matched to interested raisers <strong>(At Cornell, we train you to become a

                    <p>Raisers pick up an 8-12 week old puppy. The raiser then has the puppy for around 1.5 years (you
                        can also “start” or “finish” dogs). At 4 months, the puppies have a Walk and Talk Test to get a
                        vest. At 10 months, the puppies have another Walk and Talk Test to try on their harness for the
                        first time.They then have another check in at 13 months.</p>
